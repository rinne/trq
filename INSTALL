Deque library libtrq.a, public headers and manual pages are installed
with following procedure:

	If you want to use configure:

		1. ./configure
		2. make
		3. make test
		4. make install (as root if needed)

	Configure by hand:

		1. Copy Makefile.sample to Makefile and edit it
		   to conform with your system.
		2. Copy deque_conf.h.sample to deque_conf.h and
		   edit line "typedef unsigned int trq_p_i_t" so
		   that trq_p_i_t is defined as unsigned integer
		   type size of a pointer.
		3. make
		4. make test
		5. make install

If you use trq in a software you need to debug, file trq-gdbinit
contents some useful macros you can use in examination of trq 
deques and lists.  File can be added to your ~/.gdbinit.
