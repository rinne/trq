2013-05-13  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Moved to git!

2001-10-10  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Added shuffling.

2001-10-09  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Moved back from SSH source tree.  Million fixes and
	  changes imported, most of which only visible in logs
	  of the source files.

1998-07-06  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Utilized automake.

1998-06-23  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Removed ___func from symbol names.

1998-06-22  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Swapping implemented for lists.

	* Fixed swapping.

	* Fixed trq_*_member functions.

	* Removed all _p lispisms from function names.

	* Improved testing.

	* Made function versions of the inline stuff (trq_*_x.h) 
	  compile from automagically generated source files, one 
	  from each.
	
	* Snapshot.

1998-06-18  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Heavy rethinking of the concepts in the deque
	  and the list.  For now on both deque and list
	  start from `tail' and end to `head'.  Sorting
	  functions make order ascending from tail to head.
	  Moving list pointer forward, move it towards head
	  and moving it backwards move it towards tail.

	  Terms head and tail are utilized also in lists
	  replacing old `first' and `last'.

	  Now they should make sense.

	* Snapshot.

	* Test programs made more extensive and about
	  million fixes because of this.
	
	* Another snapshot.

	* Fixed couple annoying bugs.

	* Yet another snapshot.

1998-06-17  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Each test binary have now source file of its own.

	* Snapshot.

1998-06-11  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Moved test stuff to subdirectories.

1998-04-23  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Added sorting for lists too.

	* Added trq_list_rewind_to and trq_list_rewind_find to rewind 
	  list pointer to the arbitrary item.

	* Removed explicit macro calls from _x files.  They are not 
	  needed anyway, because inlines are not included if macros
	  aren't on.

	* Added trq_deque_get_nth.

	* Made single TRQ_USE_FUNCTIONS instead of separate ones for 
	  lists	and deques.

	* Snapshot

1998-04-22  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Snapshot

1998-04-21  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* TRQ_*_NO_ITEM -> TRQ_NO_ITEM
	  That's a NULL anyway so no need for several.

	* Made push/pop and put/get to be aliases to the suitable
	  operations to make FILO (stack) and FIFO (queue).

	* Added trq_deque_test_and_get.

	* Made typedefs for `callback' function types.

1998-04-20  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Added sorting functions.  Bubblesort, mergesort and quicksort
	  implemented. 

	* Final solution for deque basic operation names.
	  Now they are trq_deque_insert_head, trq_deque_insert_tail,
	  trq_deque_get_head and trq_deque_get_tail.  After intensive
	  customer survey, this seems to be the most intuitive way.

	* Snapshot

1998-04-18  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Renamed API functions to more intuitive form:
	  trq_deque_put_last to trq_deque_put,
	  trq_deque_put to trq_deque_push,
	  trq_deque_get_last to trq_deque_pop,
	  trq_deque_mapcar_bw to trq_deque_mapcar_reverse,
	  trq_list_mapcar_bw to trq_list_mapcar_reverse,
	  trq_deque_join_bw to trq_deque_join_begin and
	  trq_deque_join to trq_deque_join_end.  Now list
	  stuff seems at least somewhat comprehensible.

	* Added trq_deque_swap.

	* Snapshot.
	
1998-04-17  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* All API functions, types and constants should now be
	  prefixed with trq_ or TRQ_.

	* API should now be freezed.

	* Fixed makefile so that compilation can be done
	  also outside of the source directory.

	* Fixed list stuff so that list pointer and list
	  order is even somewhat meaningful.

	* Renamed some trq_list_get_forward and
	  trq_list_get_backward to ..._fw and ..._bw.

	* Added mapcar_bw to both list and deque.

	* Added list_to_deque and deque_to_list.
	
	* Snapshot done.

1998-04-16  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Renamed headers and library files trq_ prefixed.

	* Added trq_deque_mapcar and trq_list_mapcar.

	* Utilized RCS.

1998-04-15  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Renamed to libtrq.a

	* Added libtrqtest.a

	* Adopted BSD style copyright.  Former one didn't actually
	  allow anything. 

1995-1997   Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* Million fixes and additions.

1995-11-22  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>
	
	* First version of list stuff.

1995-11-18  Timo J. Rinne  <tri@iki.fi>

	* First version of deque stuff.
