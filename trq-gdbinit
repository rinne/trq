document trq-first
Print the first item of the trq deque.
Usage: trq-first deque
Argument is of type (trq_deque *)
After this command, trq-next traverses list from head to tail.
end

document trq-last
Print the last item of the trq deque.
Usage: trq-first deque
Argument is of type (trq_deque *)
After this command, trq-next traverses list from tail to head.
end

document trq-next
Print the next item of the trq deque.
Usage: trq-next
The deque have to be reset with trq-first or trq-last before
trq-next is called.
end

document trq-print

end

document trq-print-reverse
Print the contents of the trq deque in reverse order.
Usage: trq-print-reverse deque
Argument is of type (trq_deque *)
end

document trq-lprint
